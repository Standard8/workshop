# Data Tiles

The WebGL tile layer renderer allows us to manipulate pixel values before rendering.  In this exercise, we'll use a tileset that encodes elevation data as RGB values.  In this section, we'll create a map that gives the user control over sea level.  With a sea level value from a range input, we'll render the user adjusted sea level over a basemap.

* [Render elevation data](elevation.md)
* [Render sea level](sea-level.md)
